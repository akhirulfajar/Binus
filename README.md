"Binus" is my personal GitHub repository that I use to store all my coursework at Binus University, where I am majoring in Computer Science. In this repository, I keep various codes, documents, and projects related to my university studies. It chronicles my academic journey from basic programming to advanced concepts. Additionally, you can find interesting projects that I've worked on during my time at Binus University.
